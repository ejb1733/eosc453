                  <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                </div>
                <blockquote> 
                  <div class=Section1>A course in the analysis and processing 
                    of data is of absolutely central importance in a majority 
                    of disciplines. In Geophysics, our observations of the earth, 
                    our data, are often gathered in&nbsp; the form of signals.&nbsp; 
                    These signals can be manipulated to extract information from 
                    them.&nbsp; A particularly important task, is the identification 
                    and separation of signal from noise.&nbsp; This quest is application 
                    dependent, because what is signal to some applications may 
                    be noise to others.&nbsp; Also, signal and noise vary in time 
                    and frequency content from discipline to discipline. Different 
                    transformations and filters are designed with this in mind. 
                    A deep comprehension of how transforms and <br>
                    filters work often allows one the extraction of useful information 
                    from noisy data. 
                    <p>These signals are often recorded as a discrete set of numbers 
                      over time, in which case we call them time series. This 
                      course deals mainly with the analysis of time series. The 
                      same techniques can be use for any series of numbers, independently 
                      of the independent variable utilized. <br>
                      The principles and techniques that we will explore here 
                      have application to fields such as astronomy, economics, 
                      statistics, electrical engineering, etc.

                  <div class=Section1> 
                    <p>A very important ingredient of any course is the book. 
                      <br>
                      There is no "ideal" book for this course, because most text 
                      books on signal processing are written for electrical engineers, 
                      rather than Geophysicists.&nbsp; However, following a book 
                      makes the course easier&nbsp; for everybody. Therefore, 
                      we will use the following book, 
                    <p><i>Signal Processing and Linear Systems by B.P. Lathi (Berkeley-Cambridge). 
                      </i>
                    <p>We will use most of this book in detail, some parts in 
                      less detail and very few parts not at all. The book contains 
                      many exercises in Matlab.&nbsp; Students do not need any 
                      prior knowledge of Matlab. The introductory lecture in the 
                      first laboratory period will give you all the required ammunition 
                      and will allow you to master this important language placing 
                      a very important tool at your disposal.
